## Description
This project is based on the idea of the [Presence One](https://shop.everythingsmart.io/en-de/products/everything-presence-one-kit). 
I made my own, less expensive, modular & open-source version of it.

This board covers all the features of the original, plus these extras:
- swappable modules
- open-source
- additional sensors
  - air pressure
  - air quality
- modular
- less expensive
- customizable

Supported sensors are listed in the documentation: [Sensor Modules](https://github.com/Schluggi/AIOsense/wiki/How-to-start%3F#3-sensor-modules)

## What does it look like? ðŸ‘€

> **Note:** The PCB in this image is not fully equipped either is this the final case design ([issue](https://github.com/Schluggi/AIOsense/issues/9)).
